# Uses
 
 
## Direct Use
 
More information needed
 
## Downstream Use [Optional]
 
This model can also be used for the task of named entity recognition, cloze-style question answering, fine-grained entity typing, extractive question answering.
 
## Out-of-Scope Use
 
The model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people.
 
# Bias, Risks, and Limitations
 
Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.
 
 
## Recommendations
 
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.

LUKE achieves state-of-the-art results on five popular NLP benchmarks including
* **[SQuAD v1.1](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)** (extractive
question answering),
* **[CoNLL-2003](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/)** (named entity
recognition), **[ReCoRD](https://sheng-z.github.io/ReCoRD-explorer/)**
(cloze-style question answering),
* **[TACRED](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/tacred/)** (relation
classification), and
* **[Open Entity](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~eunsol/html_pages/open_entity.html)** (entity typing).
