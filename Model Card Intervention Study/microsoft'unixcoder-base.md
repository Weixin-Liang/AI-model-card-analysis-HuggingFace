# Model Card for UniXcoder-base

 
 
# Model Details
 
## Model Description
UniXcoder is a unified cross-modal pre-trained model that leverages multimodal data (i.e. code comment and AST) to pretrain code representation.

# Bias, Risks, and Limitations
 
Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.
 
 
## Recommendations
 
 
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.

### Factors
 
The model creators note in the [associated paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03850):
 
> UniXcoder has slightly worse BLEU-4 scores on both code summarization and generation tasks. The main reasons may come from two aspects. One is the amount of NL-PL pairs in the pre-training data
 
### Metrics
 
The model creators note in the [associated paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03850):
 
> We evaluate UniXcoder on five tasks over nine public datasets, including two understanding tasks, two generation tasks and an autoregressive task. To further evaluate the performance of code fragment embeddings, we also propose a new task called zero-shot code-to-code search.
 
## Results 
 
The model creators note in the [associated paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03850):
 
>Taking zero-shot code-code search task as an example, after removing contrastive learning, the performance drops from 20.45% to 13.73%.
