# Model Card for JavaBERT
 
A BERT-like model pretrained on Java software code.
 
 
 
 
 
 
# Model Details
 
## Model Description
 
A BERT-like model pretrained on Java software code.
 
- **Developed by:** Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel (CAUKiel)
- **Shared by [Optional]:** Hugging Face
- **Model type:** Fill-Mask
- **Language(s) (NLP):** en
- **License:** Apache-2.0
- **Related Models:** A version of this model using an uncased tokenizer is available at [CAUKiel/JavaBERT-uncased](https://huggingface.co/CAUKiel/JavaBERT-uncased).
  - **Parent Model:** BERT
- **Resources for more information:**

# Uses
 
## Direct Use
 
Fill-Mask
 
## Downstream Use [Optional]
 
More information needed.
 
## Out-of-Scope Use
 
The model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. 
 
# Bias, Risks, and Limitations
 
Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.
 
 
## Recommendations
 
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.
