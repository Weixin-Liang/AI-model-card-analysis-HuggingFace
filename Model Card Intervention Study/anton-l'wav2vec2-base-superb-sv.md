# Uses
 
 
## Direct Use
 
This is a ported version of 
[S3PRL's Wav2Vec2 for the SUPERB Speaker Verification task](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl/tree/master/s3prl/downstream/sv_voxceleb1).

The base model is [wav2vec2-large-lv60](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-lv60), which is pretrained on 16kHz 
sampled speech audio. When using the model make sure that your speech input is also sampled at 16Khz. 

For more information refer to [SUPERB: Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01051)
 
## Out-of-Scope Use
 
The model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people.
 
# Bias, Risks, and Limitations
 
Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.
 
 
## Recommendations
 
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.
