# Uses
 
 
## Direct Use
 
This model can be used for the task of Text2Text Generation
 
## Downstream Use [Optional]
 
More information needed
 
## Out-of-Scope Use
 
The model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people.
 
# Bias, Risks, and Limitations
 
Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.
 
 
## Recommendations
 
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.
 
 
# Training Details
 
## Training Data
 
The model is pre-trained on the [Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4)](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4), which was developed and released in the context of the same [research paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf) as T5.
 
The model was pre-trained on a on a **multi-task mixture of unsupervised (1.) and supervised tasks (2.)**.
See the [T5-small model card](https://huggingface.co/t5-small?text=My+name+is+Wolfgang+and+I+live+in+Berlin) for further training data details.
