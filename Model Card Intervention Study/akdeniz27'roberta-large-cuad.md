# Model Card for RoBERTa Large Model fine-tuned with CUAD dataset
 
This model is the fine-tuned version of "RoBERTa Large" using CUAD dataset
 
 
 
 
 
# Model Details
 
## Model Description
 
The [Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD)](https://www.atticusprojectai.org/cuad), pronounced "kwad", a dataset for legal contract review curated by the Atticus Project. 
 
Contract review is a task about "finding needles in a haystack."
We find that Transformer models have nascent performance on CUAD, but that this performance is strongly influenced by model design and training dataset size. Despite some promising results, there is still substantial room for improvement. As one of the only large, specialized NLP benchmarks annotated by experts, CUAD can serve as a challenging research benchmark for the broader NLP community.

# Uses
 
## Direct Use
 
Legal contract review
 
## Downstream Use [Optional]
 
More information needed
 
## Out-of-Scope Use
 
 
The model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. 
 
# Bias, Risks, and Limitations
 
Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.
 
 
## Recommendations
 
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recomendations.
